# code-refactor-horiseon
Refactor the horiseon web page to make it more accessible for the visual/auditorial impaired and optimized for search engines. The starter code was given to each student in the UCI boot camp to go off of, and our job was to make the code and website more accessible for the visually and auditorially impaired by refactoring the codes to HTML5 semantics.
